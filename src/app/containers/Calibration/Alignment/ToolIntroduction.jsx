            Reasonable care during assembly will give an adequately square CNC machine, but if
            you’re looking to more finely tune your setup then this tool is for you.
          </p>

          <p>
            Prepare your router collet by placing a tipped geometry inside, this could be a tapered
            bit, a v-bit, or even a sharpened dowel. Also have 3 squares of tape that you’ve marked
            with an ‘X’ and a long straight-edge ruler or measuring tape on hand.
          </p>

          <p>
            Before starting, please jog your machine to a spot on the front, left corner of the
            wasteboard, with the tip only slightly offset from the board.
