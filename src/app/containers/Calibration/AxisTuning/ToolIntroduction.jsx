          All CNCs ship with standard settings so the controller knows how much to turn the motors
          in order to move 1mm, a factor of the specs of the motors and the pitch of the lead
          screws.
        </p>

        <p>
          Manufacturing tolerances can make these presets inaccurate, meaning a move of 200mm could
          move 200.5mm in reality. If you’re looking to use your CNC for more accurate work or run a
          diagnosis, this tool is for you.
        </p>

        <p>
          Before starting, you’ll want to have a marker or some tape on hand and a measuring tape to
          keep track of machine movements.
